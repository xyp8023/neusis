# Usage

## Anaconda Environment
  Create a virtual python environment using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual):
  ```
  conda create -n neusis python=3
  conda activate neusis
  ```

## Setup

Install [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
```
pip install torch==1.13.1+cu117
```

then:
``` shell
 git clone https://github.com/xyp8023/neusis.git
 cd neusis
 pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data 
Sample datasets are available for download here [datasets](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/161PNPuIfsIwAsRjOc2PXQUkjO4F0P5Nr?usp=sharing). Unzip the files inside the ```data``` directory.   
The data is organized as follows:

```
data/<dataset_name>
|-- Data
    |-- <pose 1>.pkl        # data for each view (includes the sonar image and pose)
    |-- <pose 2>.pkl 
    ...
|-- Config.json      # Sonar configuration
```

## Running
Training:

``` python run_sdf.py --conf confs/<dataset_name>.conf ```

Example:
``` python run_sdf.py --conf confs/14deg_submarine.conf ```

The resulting meshes are saved in the following directory ```experiments/<dataset_name>/meshes```. The parameter ```val_mesh_freq``` in  ```confs/<dataset_name>.conf``` controls the frequency of mesh generation.


# Notes on training
1) We used an NVIDIA 3090 GPU for training. Depending on available compute, consider adjusting the following parameters in ```confs/<dataset_name>.conf```:

Parameter  | Description
------------- | -------------
arc_n_samples  | number of samples along each arc
num_select_pixels  | number of sampled pixels (px)
percent_select_true | percentage of px with intensity > ```Îµ``` that are be selected every training iteration
n_samples | number of samples along each acoustic ray


2) Depending on weight initialization, we noticed that the network might converge to "bad" local minimas. A quick way to make sure that the network is training correctly is to check that the ```intensity Loss``` is decreasing after a handful of epochs. Otherwise, please restart the training.

This issue could be mitigated via data normalization and enabling geometric initialization of network weights: [Issue](https://github.com/rpl-cmu/neusis/issues/1)
